Just for funzies
Welp, I have no idea what I'm doing, but here I am.
My name is Calvin. I'm 16 years old and I'm an aspiring doctor. I want to be a doctor because I really love the study of medicine, but also because Dr. Paradise is a SICK name.
Maybe if the whole doctor thing doesn't work out I can host a TV show. Kinda like Ellen.
